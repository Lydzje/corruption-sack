# corruption-sack (not finished)
My first entry in [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules/) jams. It was the 35th edition (April 15th-18th, 2016) and the theme was shapeshifting. I joined for the Compo (a game in 48h from scratch) and I failed :P

If you wanna try it, click [here](https://github.com/Lydzje/corruption-sack/raw/master/bin/corruptionSack.jar) to download an executable jar.

In my Linux system I had to install OpenJFX in order to make it run:
```shell
sudo apt-get install openjfx
```
There may be some bugs, I found some testing it now. I was very unexperienced with gamedev when I made it and everything is a mess.
