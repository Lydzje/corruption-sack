# corruption-sack (not finished)
My first entry in Ludum Dare jams. It was the 35th edition and the theme was shapeshifting. I joined for the Compo (a game in 48h from scratch) and I failed :P

Click [here](https://github.com/Lydzje/corruption-sack/raw/master/bin/corruptionSackV2.jar) to download an executable jar.

In my Linux system I had to install OpenJFX in order to make it run:
```shell
sudo apt-get install openjfx
```
